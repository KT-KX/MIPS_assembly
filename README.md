# MIPS_assembly
This project demonstrates the use of MIPS assembly language to implement two separate programs:  1. A program to read multiple integers from the user, count the odd integers, and calculate their sum.  2. A program to continuously prompt the user to enter integers, track the smallest and largest values, and exit when 0 is entered.
